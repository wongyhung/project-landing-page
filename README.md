# project-landing-page

This project is part of **The Odin Project** and focuses on creating a landing page. It is designed to demonstrate HTML, CSS. I then added new styling and JavaScript to showcase responsiveness and visual appeal.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts for different screen sizes, ensuring usability on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **JavaScript Interactivity**: Includes features like animations and dynamic content loading using JavaScript.
- **Custom Styling**: Focuses on clean, modern UI with CSS animations and grid layouts.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Markup language used to structure the content.
- **CSS3**: Used for styling the layout and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: To handle interactive elements and dynamic content loading.
- **IntersectionObserver API**: Used to trigger animations when elements come into view.
